# sumologic-aws-observability-terraform

The AWS Observability Solution provides an established framework to simplify the monitoring and troubleshooting of your AWS cloud infrastructure. The AWS Observability Solution can be deployed across multiple accounts and regions:
- minimizing the time it takes to get operational insights across your AWS infrastructure.
- identifying elements that are subject to specific operational issues across your AWS infrastructure.
- minimizing the time it takes to assign operational to the correct business units and functional teams in your AWS infrastructure.

*This Terraform script installs the Sumo Logic AWS Observability solution CloudFormation template in your AWS account to setup all necessary Sumo Logic and AWS Resources.*

*The Terraform solution will deploy the Solution Per AWS Account Per AWS Region only. For deploying as multiple AWS account Multiple AWS regions, please [visit](https://help.sumologic.com/Solutions/AWS_Observability_Solution/03_Set_Up_the_AWS_Observability_Solution#Multi_Account.2C_Multi_Region_installation_using_Stack_Sets).*

For more details, Please look at [Sumo Logic AWS Observability Help Document](https://help.sumologic.com/Solutions/AWS_Observability_Solution/About_the_AWS_Observability_Solution).

## Getting Started

#### Requirements

* [Terraform 0.12.20+](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
* Required Terraform providers (tested on mentioned versions), these providers are automatically installed on `terraform init`:
  * [Null](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/null/index.html) "~> 2.1"
  * [AWS Terraform Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html) "~> 3.0"
  * [Sumo Logic Terraform Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/sumologic/index.html) "~> 2.0"

#### Setup working directory

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-solution-templates.git
```
2. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and make sure it's on your PATH.
3. Initialize the Terraform working directory and download the official providers by navigating to the directory `sumologic-solution-templates/aws-observability-terraform` and running `terraform init`. This will install the required Terraform providers i.e. [Sumo Logic Terraform Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/sumologic/index.html), [Null](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/null/index.html) and [AWS Terraform Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html).
4. You can choose which Sumo Logic apps, Sumo Logic sources and AWS S3 Buckets to install by updating various flags in `main_variables.auto.tfvars`.
5. Update the placeholder values in `main_variables.auto.tfvars` so they correspond with your Sumo Logic and AWS environments. See the [list of input parameters](#configurable-parameters) below.
6. Update the AWS provider in `main.tf` so it correspond to the AWS environment and region where you would like to deploy the Solution.

#### Deploy Sumo Logic - AWS Observability Solution

To deploy Sumo Logic - AWS Observability Solution, navigate to the directory `sumologic-solution-templates/aws-observability-terraform` and execute the below commands:

```shell
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
#### Uninstall Sumo Logic - AWS Observability Solution

To uninstall the solution, navigate to the directory `sumologic-solution-templates/aws-observability-terraform` and execute the below command:

```shell
$ terraform destroy
```
There are times when you want to plan the destroy prior to executing the command. To do so, add the -destroy flag to the terraform plan command and then apply the destroy command, for example:

```shell
$ terraform plan -destroy
$ terraform destroy
```

## Configurable Parameters
